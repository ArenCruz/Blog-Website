                <p class="thePara">As an incoming second year Computer Science student, 
                I must say that there is still a lot to learn in this field. 
                Looking back on my experience this past year, 
                I have faced many trials- and that's completely normal. Here are the things I've learned this year:</p>
                <h2 class="subHeading">Master the Fundamentals</h2>
                <p class="thePara">This one is sort of a no-brainer, but I feel like it's something that also needs
                    to be addressed. Like any skill, mastering the fundamentals is a must. To be frank, I've fallen into the
                    trap of not following this advice before. So, heading into my freshmen year of college, I made sure to have the mindset
                    of prioritizing the fundamentals. Although I'm not the perfect programmer, keeping this in mind
                    definitely helps in whatever skill you're trying to master. In this field, most of the things you'll be doing
                    will circulate around those fundamentals. Just think of them as basic ingredients. When learning other programming languages, 
                    the same concepts will still apply, the only thing changed is the syntax. Here are the fundamental concepts you should know:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="concepts">Variables</li>
                    <li class="concepts">Data Types</li>
                    <li class="concepts">Flow Control/Conditional Statements (If Statements and Switch Cases)</li>
                    <li class="concepts">Loops (While/For/Do While Loops)</li>
                    <li class="concepts">Functional Programming (Functions)</li>
                    <li class="concepts">Object Oriented Programming (Classes and Objects)</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="subHeading">Self-study</h2>
                <p class="thePara">I've always been a slow learner all my life. Currently, I still am. 
                    However, that has never stopped me from learning on my own. If you're someone that is 
                    interested in taking Computer Science, you have to know that it'll always be a constant
                    state of learning. You should never be content with the concepts you learn inside the classroom. 
                    Make it a must to continually learn on your own. There are many resources available on the internet. Be interested, be curious. That's the best way to learn.
                    While yes, the concepts you learn inside the classroom are important, keep note that this field is broad.
                    So broad that there's even a vast amount of information even professionals don't know about. 
                    Also, remember that there are many paths that a programmer can take. You'll never know which one you're interested in, 
                    unless you venture on your own. Here are the most common paths programmerss take (Note that there are more):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="concepts">Software Developer/Engineer</li>
                    <li class="concepts">Web Developer</li>
                    <li class="concepts">Mobile App Developer</li>
                    <li class="concepts">Data Scientist</li>
                    <li class="concepts">Cloud Engineer</li>
                    <li class="concepts">Database Administrator</li>
                    <li class="concepts">Cybersecurity Analyst</li>
                    <li class="concepts">DevOps Engineer</li>
                    <li class="concepts">Game Developer</li>
                    <li class="concepts">Machine Learning Engineer</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="subHeading">You're Gonna Fail (A lot)</h2>
                <p class="thePara">Computer Science revolves around problem-solving, and you're bound to fail many times. That's just 
                    how it works. Your code will have many errors, causing it to not run, then causing you to rewrite the code until it works. 
                    It goes on and on until you finish your session. This is why patience is needed. Remembering that I am always going
                    to fail kept my grounded in times where I felt like I couldn't solve the problem anymore. It's something I still
                    tell myself today. There's nothing really else to elaborate on here. It's very simple. You're gonna fail.
